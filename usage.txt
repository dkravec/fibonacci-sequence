Future Functions will be created into the Fibonacci Sequence project.

functions you can run

indexArray Function

fibseq.indexArray(number / array, lowest / highest
returns index in sequence
check justAnswers.json for array of numbers

examples
- fibseq.indexArray(3)
returns: 2
- fibseq.indexArray(5) 
returns: 8


closestIndex function:
fibseq.closestIndex(number / array, up / down?); 
fibseq.closestIndex(data, rounding?);

returns closest number to that number input

you can return mutiple into an array
will take closest of each + closest of all


you can add rounding type, (up / down)
by default rounding is up

// example array with default rounding
const array = [1, 3, 4, 29]
fibseq.closestResult(array)
returns : [1, 3, 5, 34] 


// example array plus rounding up
const array = [1, 3, 4, 29]
fibseq.closestResult(array, up)
returns : [1, 3, 5, 34] // which is 

// example array plus rounding down
const array = [1, 3, 4, 29]
fibseq.closestResult(array, down)
returns : [1, 3, 3, 21] // which is 


// example number with default rounding #1
fibseq.closestResult(3)
returns : 3 // which is 3

// example number with default rounding #2
fibseq.closestResult(4)
returns : 3  // which is 4

// example number with rounding down
fibseq.closestResult(4, down)
returns : 3  // which is 3

// example number with rounding up
fibseq.closestResult(4, up)
returns : 3  // which is 4
